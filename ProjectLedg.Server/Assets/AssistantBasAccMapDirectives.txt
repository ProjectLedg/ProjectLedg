    "Example response: [
        "  { \"BasAccount\": 5040, \"Description\": \"Vatten och avlopp\", \"Debit\": 191.23, \"Credit\": 0 },
        "  { \"BasAccount\": 5170, \"Description\": \"Reparation och underhåll av fastighet\", \"Debit\": 30.41, \"Credit\": 0 },
        "  { \"BasAccount\": 5060, \"Description\": \"Renhållning\", \"Debit\": 27.01, \"Credit\": 0 },
        "  { "BasAccount": 3001, "Description": "Försäljning inom Sverige", "Debit": 0, "Credit": 5000.00 }
        "  { \"BasAccount\": 2640, \"Description\": \"Ingående moms\", \"Debit\": 133.58, \"Credit\": 0 },
        "  { \"BasAccount\": 3740, \"Description\": \"Öres- och kronutjämning\", \"Debit\": 0.10, \"Credit\": 0 }
    "]"*
    - Where BasAccount is the BasAccount number according to the Swedish Bas Account Chart. 
    - Description is the description of that bas account class NOT the item on the invoice.

    - Map each item in this invoice to the most specific and appropriate BAS account. Follow these instructions carefully:
        1. Map each item to the **most specific BAS account** relevant to its nature, and avoid using general accounts like 5000 and 5060 unless there is no suitable alternative.
        2. If an item description or context includes terms related to water or sewage (e.g., 'Förbrukningsavgift', 'Fast avgift', 'Grundavgift villa'), use **5040 - Vatten och avlopp**.
        3. If an item description or context includes terms related to waste management (e.g., 'Matavfall', 'Brännbart'), use **5060 - Renhållning**.
        4. Use the **BAS account description** in the `Description` field, not the item description from the invoice.
        5. For water and sewage expenses, always use **5040 - Vatten och avlopp**.
        6. For VAT, use **2640 - Ingående moms** and assign the `totalTax` amount to `Debit`.
        7. For minor rounding differences, use **3740 - Öres- och kronutjämning** but only if there is an actual discrepancy when totaling debits and credits. Avoid creating entries in 3740 unless there is a non-zero rounding difference.
        8. Calculate the **rounding difference**, even if it’s very small (e.g., 0.10 SEK or less):
            - Sum all Debit entries and compare the result to the invoice total.
            - If the sum of Debits is **less than the invoice total**, add the difference as a **Debit** to **3740 - Öres- och kronutjämning**.
            - If the sum of Debits is **more than the invoice total**, add the difference as a **Credit** to **3740 - Öres- och kronutjämning**.    
            - Record all non-zero differences in **3740 - Öres- och kronutjämning**, no matter how small.
        9. Assign the `Amount` field of each item to `Debit` or `Credit`:
           - If the item represents an expense (e.g., utilities or waste), assign the `Amount` to `Debit`.
           - If the item represents income or a refund, assign the `Amount` to `Credit`.
           - Do not set both `Debit` and `Credit` to `0` if an `Amount` is specified.
